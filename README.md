## Homework 1
Implement the linear regression model and train it by using gradient descent with mean absolute error and mean square error as the objective function, respectively.

## Homework 2
Implement Fisherâ€™s linear discriminant, then train your model on the provided dataset, and evaluate the performance on testing data.

## Homework 3
Implement the decision tree and random forest algorithm.

## Homework 4
Implement the cross-validation and grid search by using only NumPy, then train the SVM model from scikit-learn on the providing dataset and test the performance.

## Homework 5
Implement the deep neural network by any deep learning framework, e.g. Pytorch, TensorFlow, or Keras, then train the DNN model by the Cifar-10 dataset.
